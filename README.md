# Introduction

ComfyUI is the most powerful and modular stable diffusion GUI and backend. But it is not easy to use, and has a high learning curve. We build Apps 
based on the workflows, and provide several interfaces, like input prompt, upload image, upload video. You do not need 
to take care of the workflow details, what is your focus is only your content. We plan to 
provide follow functionalities, but we only support "Text to image" so far:

- Text to Image, Text to Video
- Image to Image, Image to video
- Video to video

We also plan to support upload workflow to customize your app in the future.

## Roadmap

# Install
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
